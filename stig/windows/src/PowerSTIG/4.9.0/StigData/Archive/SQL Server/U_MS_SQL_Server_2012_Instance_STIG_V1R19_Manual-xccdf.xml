USE &lt;database name&gt;
CREATE SYMMETRIC KEY &lt;'key name'&gt;
   WITH ALGORITHM = AES_256 
   ENCRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE &lt;certificate name&gt;

Assign the application object owner account as the owner of asymmetric and symmetric keys, and certificates.  (Ownership is assigned via the AUTHORIZATION clause of the CREATE statement, or the ALTER AUTHORIZATION statement.)

Create audit events for access to the key by other than the application owner account or approved application objects.  (If using a server-level SQL Server Audit specification, DATABASE_OBJECT_PERMISSION_CHANGE_GROUP accomplishes this.)

Revoke any privileges on encryption keys assigned to principals other than the application object owner account and authorized users.

If cryptography is being used by SQL Server, examine evidence that an audit record is created whenever the asymmetric key is accessed by other than authorized users. In particular, view evidence that access by a SYSADMIN or other system privileged account results in the generation of an audit record. This is required because system privileges allow access to encryption keys and can be used to access sensitive data where there is not a need-to-know.

If any ports, protocols, and/or services that are not approved or are not used, are available, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-40934"><title>SRG-APP-000142-DB-000094</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-53288r3_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>SQL2-00-017300</version><title>SQL Server must specifically prohibit or restrict the use of unauthorized functions and services in each instance.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;SQL Server is capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services.

Note 1: It is highly advisable to use a separate account for each service. When installing SQL Server in single-server mode, you can opt to have these provisioned for you. These automatically generated accounts are referred to as virtual accounts. Each virtual account has an equivalent Service SID, with the same name. The installer also creates an equivalent SQL Server login, also with the same name. Applying folder and file permissions to Service SIDs, rather than to domain accounts or local computer accounts, provides tighter control because these permissions are available only to the specific service when it is running and not in any other context. (However, when using failover clustering, a domain account must be specified at installation, rather than a virtual account.) For more on this topic, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143504(v=sql.110).aspx.

Any time new software code is introduced to a system there is the potential for unintended consequences.

From a Command Prompt, type regedit.exe, and press [ENTER].

Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt;&gt; SOFTWARE &gt;&gt; Microsoft &gt;&gt; Microsoft SQL Server &gt;&gt; Instance Names. Each instance installed on the server possesses a key inside a folder under this registry entry.

Analysis Services Instances are registered in the OLAP subfolder.
Reporting Services Instances are registered in the RS subfolder.
Standard SQL Server Instances are registered in the SQL subfolder.

Inside each of these folders, a single key is used to reference an Instance's specific Windows Registry tree. Each key will have its own registry tree at the following registry location: 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt;&gt; SOFTWARE &gt;&gt; Microsoft &gt;&gt; Microsoft SQL Server &gt;&gt; [INSTANCE NAME].

An [INSTANCE NAME] is listed as the Data component of a key found in one of the above OLAP, RS, or SQL folders.  

To find the installation location of a particular instance, navigate to the following location in the Windows Registry:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt;&gt; SOFTWARE &gt;&gt; Microsoft &gt;&gt; Microsoft SQL Server &gt;&gt; [INSTANCE NAME] &gt;&gt; Setup.  

Examine the value of the 'SqlProgramDir' key. The value of the 'SqlProgramDir' key is the SQL Server installation directory for that SQL Server Instance.

Navigate to that folder location using a Command Prompt or Windows Explorer. Only applications that are required for the functioning and administration, not use, of the SQL Server should be located on the same directory node as the SQL Server software libraries.

If the application were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

This requirement is contingent upon the language in which the application is programmed, as many application architectures in use today incorporate their software libraries into, and make them inseparable from, their compiled distributions, rendering them static and version dependant.

Multiple applications can provide a cumulative negative effect. A vulnerability and subsequent exploit of one application can lead to an exploit of other applications sharing the same security context. For example, an exploit of a web server process that leads to unauthorized administrative access to host system directories can most likely lead to a compromise of all applications hosted by the same system. Database software not installed using dedicated directories both threatens, and is threatened by, other hosted applications. Access controls defined for one application may, by default, provide access to other applications’ database objects or directories.

Note 1:  It is highly advisable to use a separate account for each service.  When installing SQL Server in single-server mode, you can opt to have these provisioned for you.  These automatically-generated accounts are referred to as virtual accounts.  Each virtual account has an equivalent Service SID, with the same name.  The installer also creates an equivalent SQL Server login, also with the same name.  Applying folder and file permissions to Service SIDs, rather than to domain accounts or local computer accounts, provides tighter control, because these permissions are available only to the specific service when it is running, and not in any other context.  (However, when using failover clustering, a domain account must be specified at installation, rather than a virtual account.)

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;true&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2561</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000162</ident><fixtext fixref="F-46314r8_fix">Edit the system security plan to include justification and authorization for any less restrictive permissions that are present and needed.

-----

Note 1:  It is highly advisable to use a separate account for each service.  When installing SQL Server in single-server mode, you can opt to have these provisioned for you.  These automatically-generated accounts are referred to as virtual accounts.  Each virtual account has an equivalent Service SID, with the same name.  The installer also creates an equivalent SQL Server login, also with the same name.  Applying folder and file permissions to Service SIDs, rather than to domain accounts or local computer accounts, provides tighter control, because these permissions are available only to the specific service when it is running, and not in any other context.  (However, when using failover clustering, a domain account must be specified at installation, rather than a virtual account.)

Auditing might not be reliable when performed by an information system that the user being audited has privileged access to.

The privileged user could inhibit auditing or directly modify audit records. To prevent this from occurring, privileged access shall be further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges, thus limiting the users with audit-related privileges.

Reducing the risk of audit compromises by privileged users can also be achieved, for example, by performing audit activity on a separate information system where the user in question has limited access, or by using storage media that cannot be modified (e.g., write-once recording devices).

3. It is acceptable to trace additional event IDs. This is the minimum list.

In many system configurations, the disk space allocated to the auditing system is separate from the disks allocated for the operating system; therefore, this may not result in a system outage. This places the onus on the DBMS to detect and take actions.

A failure of SQL Server auditing will result in either the database continuing to function without auditing, or the halting of SQL Server operations. In this case, the database must cease processing immediately in order to not allow unlogged transaction to occur.

Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include creating information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract), and receiving a message.

Non-repudiation protects individuals against later claims by an author of not having authored a particular document, a sender of not having transmitted a message, a receiver of not having received a message, or a signatory of not having signed a document.

Use of shared accounts does not provide individual accountability for actions taken on the DBMS or data. Whenever a single database account is used to connect to the database, a secondary authentication method that provides individual accountability is required. This scenario most frequently occurs when an externally hosted application authenticates individual users to the application and the application uses a single account to retrieve or update database information on behalf of the individual users (as in connection pooling).

When shared accounts are utilized without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.

Notes:
1. It is acceptable to have the required event IDs spread across multiple traces, provided all of the traces are always active, and the event IDs are grouped in a logical manner.
2. It is acceptable, from an auditing point of view, to include the same event IDs in multiple traces. However, the effect of this redundancy on performance, storage, and the consolidation of audit logs into a central repository, should be taken into account.
3. It is acceptable to trace additional event IDs. This is the minimum list.
4. Once this check is satisfied, the DBA may find it useful to disable or modify the default trace that is set up by the SQL Server installation process. (Note that the Fix does NOT include code to do this.)
Use the following query to obtain a list of all event IDs, and their meaning:
SELECT * FROM sys.trace_events;
5. Because this check procedure is designed to address multiple requirements/vulnerabilities, it may appear to exceed the needs of some individual requirements. However, it does represent the aggregate of all such requirements.
6. Microsoft has flagged the trace techniques and tools used in this Check and Fix as deprecated. They will be removed at some point after SQL Server 2014. The replacement feature is Extended Events. If Extended Events are in use, and cover all the required audit events listed above, this is not a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-41043"><title>SRG-APP-000063-DB-000017</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-53418r2_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>SQL2-00-009600</version><title>Administrators must utilize a separate, distinct administrative account when performing administrative activities, accessing database security functions, or accessing security-relevant information within SQL Server.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;This requirement is intended to limit exposure due to operating from within a privileged account or role.

Unauthorized access to this data could result in unauthorized changes to database objects, access controls, or SQL Server configuration.  Only database administrators and other authorized users must be allowed such access.

To aid in tracking and administering such permissions, individual logins must not be directly granted permissions or built-in server roles.  Instead, user-defined server roles must be created, with the permissions and built-in server roles granted to them; the individual logins must be assigned to the appropriate user-defined server roles.

The built-in server role "sysadmin" is a partial exception.  This cannot be granted to a user-defined role, only to a login account.  Most (not necessarily all) database administrators will need to be members of sysadmin.  Without this, most DBCC commands and the system stored procedures/functions listed below are unavailable.  The users who require such access must be documented and approved.  

In addition, if the site uses backup-restore software that connects to SQL Server via the Virtual Device Interface (VDI), the account used by that software must have the sysadmin role.  (See Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2926557, http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2926557).  If this applies, it must be documented and approved.

It serves to eliminate or reduce the possibility that a single user may carry out a prohibited action. Separation of duties requires that the person accountable for approving an action is not the same person who is tasked with implementing or carrying out that action.

Additionally, the person or entity accountable for monitoring the activity must be separate as well. To meet this requirement, applications, when applicable, shall be divided where functionality is based on roles and duties. Examples of separation of duties include: (i) mission functions and distinct information system support functions are divided among different individuals/roles; (ii) different individuals perform information system support functions (e.g., system management, systems programming, configuration management, quality assurance and testing, network security); (iii) security personnel who administer access control functions do not administer audit functions; and (iv) different administrator accounts for different roles.

Privileges granted outside the role of the application user job function are more likely to go unmanaged or without oversight for authorization.

DAC is a type of access control methodology serving as a means of restricting access to objects and data based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong. It is discretionary in the sense that application users with the appropriate permissions to access an application resource or data have the discretion to pass that permission on to another user either directly or indirectly.

Data protection requirements may result in a DAC policy being specified as part of the application design. Discretionary access controls would be employed at the application level to restrict and control access to application objects and data, thereby providing increased information security for the organization.

When DAC controls are employed, those controls must limit sharing to named application users, groups of users, or both. The application DAC controls must also limit the propagation of access rights and have the ability to exclude access to data down to the granularity of a single user.

Databases using DAC must have the ability for the owner of an object or information to assign or revoke rights to view or modify the object or information. If the owner of an object or information does not have rights to exclude access to an object or information at a user level, users may gain access to objects and information they are not authorized to view/modify.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2561</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-002165</ident><fixtext fixref="F-46597r2_fix">Add the user-defined server role to the system documentation.

Unauthorized access to sensitive data or SQL Server control may compromise the confidentiality of personnel privacy, threaten national security, compromise a variety of other sensitive operations or lead to a loss of system control. Access controls are best managed by defining requirements based on distinct job functions and assigning access based on the job function assigned to the individual user.

SQL Server's 'Unsafe assembly' permission is a high server-level privilege that must only be granted to individual administration accounts through roles, and users who have access must require this privilege to accomplish the organizational missions and/or functions. If the 'Unsafe assembly' permission is granted to roles that are unauthorized to have this privilege, then this access must be removed.

Additionally, the permission must not be denied to a role, because that could disable a user's legitimate access via another role.

The fix for this vulnerability specifies the use of REVOKE.  Be aware that revoking a permission that is currently denied to a role or user does not necessarily disable the permission.  If the user or role can inherent the permission from another role, revoking the denied permission from the user or the first role can effectively enable the inherited permission.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;true&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2561</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-003014</ident><fixtext fixref="F-46598r1_fix">Remove the 'Unsafe assembly' permission access from the role that is not authorized by executing the following query:

Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and SQL Server accounts as necessary to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege concepts to the design, development, implementation, and operations of SQL Server and the OS.

Unauthorized access to sensitive data or SQL Server control may compromise the confidentiality of personnel privacy, threaten national security, compromise a variety of other sensitive operations or lead to a loss of system control. Access controls are best managed by defining requirements based on distinct job functions and assigning access based on the job function assigned to the individual user.

Privileges granted outside of SQL Server's role-based account assignments are more likely to go unmanaged and without oversight of granted access. Maintenance of privileges using roles defined for discrete job functions offers improved oversight of application user privilege assignments and helps to protect against unauthorized privilege assignment.

SQL Server's 'Alter any connection' permission is a high server-level privilege that must only be granted to individual administration accounts through roles. This administrative privilege must not be assigned directly to administrative user accounts (or any other user accounts).

Unauthorized access to sensitive data or SQL Server control may compromise the confidentiality of personnel privacy, threaten national security, compromise a variety of other sensitive operations or lead to a loss of system control. Access controls are best managed by defining requirements based on distinct job functions and assigning access based on the job function assigned to the individual user.

SQL Server's 'View any database' permission is a high server-level privilege that must only be granted to individual administration accounts through roles, and users who have access must require this privilege to accomplish the organizational missions and/or functions. If the 'View any database' permission is granted to roles that are unauthorized to have this privilege, then this access must be removed.

Additionally, the permission must not be denied to a role, because that could disable a user's legitimate access via another role.

The fix for this vulnerability specifies the use of REVOKE.  Be aware that revoking a permission that is currently denied to a role or user does not necessarily disable the permission.

Access controls are best managed by defining requirements based on distinct job functions and assigning access based on the job function assigned to the individual user.

Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and SQL Server accounts as necessary to achieve least privilege.

Unauthorized access to sensitive data or SQL Server control may compromise the confidentiality of personnel privacy, threaten national security, compromise a variety of other sensitive operations or lead to a loss of system control. Access controls are best managed by defining requirements based on distinct job functions and assigning access based on the job function assigned to the individual user.

SQL Server's 'View any definition' permission is a high server-level privilege that must only be granted to individual administration accounts through roles, and users who have access must require this privilege to accomplish the organizational missions and/or functions. If the 'View any definition' permission is granted to roles that are unauthorized to have this privilege, then this access must be removed.

Additionally, the permission must not be denied to a role, because that could disable a user's legitimate access via another role.

The fix for this vulnerability specifies the use of REVOKE.  Be aware that revoking a permission that is currently denied to a role or user does not necessarily disable the permission.  If the user or role can inherent the permission from another role, revoking the denied permission from the user or the first role can effectively enable the inherited permission.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;true&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2561</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-003014</ident><fixtext fixref="F-46652r1_fix">Remove the 'View any definition' permission access from the role that is not authorized by executing the following query:

Unauthorized access to sensitive data or SQL Server control may compromise the confidentiality of personnel privacy, threaten national security, compromise a variety of other sensitive operations or lead to a loss of system control. Access controls are best managed by defining requirements based on distinct job functions and assigning access based on the job function assigned to the individual user.

Privileges granted outside of SQL Server's role-based account assignments are more likely to go unmanaged and without oversight of granted access. Maintenance of privileges using roles defined for discrete job functions offers improved oversight of application user privilege assignments and helps to protect against unauthorized privilege assignment.

SQL Server's 'Create availability group' permission is a high server-level privilege that must only be granted to individual administration accounts through roles. This administrative privilege must not be assigned directly to administrative user accounts (or any other user accounts). If any user accounts have direct access to administrative privileges, this access must be removed.

Unauthorized access to sensitive data or SQL Server control may compromise the confidentiality of personnel privacy, threaten national security, compromise a variety of other sensitive operations, or lead to a loss of system control. Access controls are best managed by defining requirements based on distinct job functions and assigning access based on the job function assigned to the individual user.

SQL Server's 'Alter any availability group' permission is a high server-level privilege that must only be granted to individual administration accounts through roles and users. If the 'Alter any availability group' permission is granted to roles that are unauthorized to have this privilege, then this access must be removed.

Additionally, the permission must not be denied to a role, because that could disable a user's legitimate access via another role.

The fix for this vulnerability specifies the use of REVOKE.  Be aware that revoking a permission that is currently denied to a role or user does not necessarily disable the permission.  If the user or role can inherent the permission from another role, revoking the denied permission from the user or the first role can effectively enable the inherited permission.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;true&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2561</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-003014</ident><fixtext fixref="F-46671r1_fix">Remove the 'Alter any availability group' permission access from the role that is not authorized  by executing the following query:

SQL Server's 'Alter any login' permission is a high server-level privilege that must only be granted to individual administration accounts through roles. If the 'Alter any login' permission is granted to roles that are unauthorized to have this privilege, then this access must be removed.

Additionally, the permission must not be denied to a role, because that could disable a user's legitimate access via another role.

The fix for this vulnerability specifies the use of REVOKE.  Be aware that revoking a permission that is currently denied to a role or user does not necessarily disable the permission.

Access controls are best managed by defining requirements based on distinct job functions and assigning access based on the job function assigned to the individual user.

Privileges granted outside of SQL Server's role-based account assignments are more likely to go unmanaged and without oversight of granted access.

SQL Server's 'Shutdown' permission is a high server-level privilege that must only be granted to individual administration accounts through roles. This administrative privilege must not be assigned directly to administrative user accounts. If administrative user accounts have direct access to administrative roles, this access must be removed.

Unauthorized access to sensitive data or SQL Server control may compromise the confidentiality of personnel privacy, threaten national security, compromise a variety of other sensitive operations or lead to a loss of system control. Access controls are best managed by defining requirements based on distinct job functions and assigning access based on the job function assigned to the individual user.

Privileges granted outside of SQL Server's role-based account assignments are more likely to go unmanaged and without oversight of granted access. Maintenance of privileges using roles defined for discrete job functions offers improved oversight of application user privilege assignments and helps to protect against unauthorized privilege assignment.

SQL Server's 'Unsafe assembly' permission is a high server-level privilege that must only be granted to individual administration accounts through roles. This administrative privilege must not be assigned directly to administrative user accounts (or any other user accounts). If any user accounts have direct access to administrative privileges, this access must be removed.

Note that this does not apply to logins with names of the form '##MS...##'.

Access controls are best managed by defining requirements based on distinct job functions and assigning access based on the job function assigned to the individual user.

SQL Server's 'Control server' permission is a high server-level privilege that must only be granted to individual administration accounts through roles, and users who have access must require this privilege to accomplish the organizational missions and/or functions. If the 'Control server' permission is granted to roles that are unauthorized to have this privilege, then this access must be removed.

Additionally, the permission must not be denied to a role, because that could disable a user's legitimate access via another role.

The fix for this vulnerability specifies the use of REVOKE.  Be aware that revoking a permission that is currently denied to a role or user does not necessarily disable the permission.

Unauthorized access to sensitive data or SQL Server control may compromise the confidentiality of personnel privacy, threaten national security, compromise a variety of other sensitive operations, or lead to a loss of system control. Access controls are best managed by defining requirements based on distinct job functions and assigning access based on the job function assigned to the individual user.

SQL Server's 'Authenticate server' permission is a high server-level privilege that must only be granted to individual administration accounts through roles. If the 'Authenticate server' permission is granted to roles that are unauthorized to have this privilege, then this access must be removed.

Additionally, the permission must not be denied to a role, because that could disable a user's legitimate access via another role.

The fix for this vulnerability specifies the use of REVOKE.  Be aware that revoking a permission that is currently denied to a role or user does not necessarily disable the permission.

Roles are set up within SQL Server to grant user accounts read and/or write permissions to system objects: databases, tables, columns, etc. After a role is created, user accounts can be assigned to a role granting them permissions of that role.

If users have permissions to database objects that they are not authorized to have, the user account that has access to the unauthorized database object must be removed from the role that grants that access. Policy rule sets would be developed to establish that each user receives only the information to which the user is authorized.

Frequently, roles grant access to multiple privileges; if a user is authorized and determined to need access to authorized privilege granted by a role, and unauthorized for other privileges of that same role, it may be necessary to split the privileges of one role into two roles.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2561</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-003014</ident><fixtext fixref="F-46695r2_fix">Add the user as a member of the user-defined server role within the system documentation.

Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Remote network and system access is accomplished by leveraging common communication protocols to establish a remote connection. These connections will typically originate over either the public Internet or the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Neither of these internetworking mechanisms is private or secure, and they do not by default restrict access to networked resources once connectivity is established.

Numerous best practices are employed to protect remote connections, such as utilizing encryption to protect data sessions and firewalls to restrict and control network connectivity. In addition to these protections, auditing must also be utilized in order to track system activity, assist in diagnosing system issues, and provide evidence needed for forensic investigations post security incident.

For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect devices on an organization’s internal network from being directly affected by DoS attacks.

One way SQL Server can limit exposure to DoS attacks is to restrict the number of connections that can be opened by a single user. SQL Server supports this through the use of logon triggers.  (Note, however, that this need not be the only, or even the principal, means for satisfying this requirement.  Depending on the architecture and capabilities of the network and application, a network device or an application may be more suitable for providing this protection.)

When determining the appropriate values for this limit, take the characteristics of the various kinds of user into account, and bear in mind that some applications and some users may need to have multiple sessions open.  For example, while a standard account using a simple application may never need more than, say, five connections, a database administrator using SQL Server Management Studio may need significantly more, because each tab in that application counts as a distinct session.

Architectural note:  In SQL Server, a count of active sessions by user can be obtained from one of the dynamic management views.   For example:

    SELECT original_login_name, count(*) 
    FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
    WHERE is_user_process = 1
    GROUP BY original_login_name;

However, for this to return an accurate count in a logon trigger, the user would have to have the View Server State privilege.  (Without this privilege, the trigger sees information only about the current session, so would always return a count of one.)  View Server State would give that user access to a wide swath of information about the server, violating SQL2-00-004100.  One way to avoid this exposure is to create a summary table, and a view of that table that restricts each user to seeing his/her own count, and establish a frequently-run background job to refresh the table (using the above query or similar).  The logon trigger then queries the view to obtain a count that is accurate enough for most purposes.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;true&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2561</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000054</ident><fixtext fixref="F-46702r5_fix">Establish the limit(s) appropriate to the type(s) of user account accessing the SQL Server instance, and record them in the system documentation.

Note 1: It is highly advisable to use a separate account for each service. When installing SQL Server in single-server mode, you can opt to have these provisioned for you. These automatically-generated accounts are referred to as virtual accounts. Each virtual account has an equivalent Service SID, with the same name. The installer also creates an equivalent SQL Server login, also with the same name. Applying folder and file permissions to Service SIDs, rather than to domain accounts or local computer accounts, provides tighter control because these permissions are available only to the specific service when it is running and not in any other context. (However, when using failover clustering, a domain account must be specified at installation, rather than a virtual account.) For more on this topic, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143504(v=sql.110).aspx.

Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and SQL Server accounts as necessary to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege concepts to the design, development, implementation, and operations of SQL Server and the OS.

Unauthorized access to sensitive data or SQL Server control may compromise the confidentiality of personnel privacy, threaten national security, compromise a variety of other sensitive operations or lead to a loss of system control. Access controls are best managed by defining requirements based on distinct job functions and assigning access based on the job function assigned to the individual user.

Privileges granted outside of SQL Server's role-based account assignments are more likely to go unmanaged and without oversight of granted access. Maintenance of privileges using roles defined for discrete job functions offers improved oversight of application user privilege assignments and helps to protect against unauthorized privilege assignment.

SQL Server's 'View Any Database' permission is a high server-level privilege that must only be granted to individual administration accounts through roles. This administrative privilege must not be assigned directly to administrative user accounts (or any other user accounts). If any user accounts have direct access to administrative privileges, this access must be removed.

Note that this does not apply to logins with names of the form '##MS...##'. These accounts are internal-use system principals provisioned by the DBMS, and required by it for specific purposes.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;true&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2561</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-001499</ident><fixtext fixref="F-60677r1_fix">Remove the 'View Any Database' permission access from the account that has direct access by running the following script:

SQL Server's 'Alter any event notification' permission is a high server-level privilege that must only be granted to individual administration accounts through roles. If the 'Alter any event notification' permission is granted to roles that are unauthorized to have this privilege, then this access must be removed.

Additionally, the permission must not be denied to a role, because that could disable a user's legitimate access via another role.

The fix for this vulnerability specifies the use of REVOKE. Be aware that revoking a permission that is currently denied to a role or user does not necessarily disable the permission. If the user or role can inherent the permission from another role, revoking the denied permission from the user or the first role can effectively enable the inherited permission.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>SQL Server Installation 2012</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2561</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-003014</ident><fixtext fixref="F-65331r1_fix">Remove the 'Alter any event notification' permission access from the role that is not authorized by executing the following query:
