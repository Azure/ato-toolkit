## Control Description

The information system, for password-based authentication:

(a) Enforces minimum password complexity of [Assignment: organization-defined requirements for case sensitivity, number of characters, mix of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters, including minimum requirements for each type];

(b) Enforces at least the following number of changed characters when new passwords are created: [Assignment: organization-defined number];

(c) Stores and transmits only cryptographically-protected passwords;

(d) Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of [Assignment: organization-defined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime maximum];

(e) Prohibits password reuse for [Assignment: organization-defined number] generations; and

(f) Allows the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password.

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities across the entire Org. environment (including the application layer:

1. Enforcing minimum password complexity (IA-5 (1).a)
2. Enforcing at least one changed character when new passwords are created (IA-5 (1).b)
3. Storing and transmitting only cryptographically-protected passwords (IA-5(1).c)
4. Enforcing minimum and maximum lifetimes restrictions of one (1) day and sixty (60) days respectively (IA-5 (1).d)
5. Prohibiting password reuse for 24 generations (IA- 5(1).e)
6. Allowing the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password (IA-5 (1).f)

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

## Part a

### Implementation Statement

Org. is responsible for enforcing minimum password complexity across all the layers of the information system.  Org. Administrators and System Administrators enable the Password Complexity policy in group policy in AD.  Passwords must be composed to be case sensitive, have a minimum of twelve characters, and at least one each of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters [for example: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * () _ + = - ' [ ] / ? > <].

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to enforce strong passwords by assigning Policy definitions that audit Windows virtual machines that don't enforce minimum strength and other password requirements. Awareness of virtual machines in violation of the password strength policy enables Org. to take corrective actions to ensure passwords for all virtual machine user accounts comply with the organization's password policy. Azure Active Directory is also used to manage control access to the information system.  The Azure Policy enables Org. to audit Windows VMs that do not have the password complexity setting enabled and audit Windows VMs that do not restrict the minimum password length to 14 characters.

## Part b

### Implementation Statement

Org. is responsible for employing password-based authentication to Org.-deployed resources and defining the number of characters to be changed when new passwords are created for these resources.  Org. requires that at least one character is changed upon changing of passwords.

## Part c

### Implementation Statement

Org. is responsible for employing password-based authentication, which stores and transmits cryptographically-protected passwords, for customer-deployed resources.

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. uses Azure Active Directory to ensure that all passwords are cryptographically protected while stored and transmitted. Passwords stored by Azure Active Directory are automatically hashed as part of built-in security functionality.  The Azure Policy enables Org. to audit Windows VMs that do not store passwords using reversible encryption.

## Part d

### Implementation Statement

Org. is responsible for enforcing Org.-defined minimum and maximum password lifetime restrictions for authentication to customer-deployed resources.  Org. establishes the minimum lifetime of one day and a maximum lifetime of sixty (60) days for privileged user accounts.

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to audit and deploy requirements to Windows VMs that do not have a maximum password age of 60 days and a minimum password age of 1 day.

## Part e

### Implementation Statement

Org. is responsible for employing password-based authentication to Org.-deployed resources and defining the number of password generations that are prohibited from reuse. The authenticators cannot be used for a total of 24 generations.

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to audit and deploy requirements to Windows VMs that allow re-use of the previous 24 passwords.

## Part f

### Implementation Statement

Whenever an account is initially created, or a temporary password is generated, Azure Active Directory is employed to require that the user change the password at the next login.
