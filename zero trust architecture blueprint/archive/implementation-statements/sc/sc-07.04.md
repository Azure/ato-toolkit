## Control Description

The organization:
(a) Implements a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;

(b) Establishes a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;

(c) Protects the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across each interface;

(d) Documents each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission/business need and duration of that need; and

(e) Reviews exceptions to the traffic flow policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and removes exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission/business need.

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities:

1. Boundary protection and access mechanisms related to protecting Virtual Machines

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

## Part a

### Implementation Statement

Org. is responsible for all boundary protection and access mechanisms related to protecting Virtual Machines.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. leverages Azure Policy to use Just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine access that locks down inbound traffic to Azure virtual machines, reducing exposure to attacks while providing easy access to connect to VMs when needed. JIT virtual machine access helps to manage exceptions to the traffic flow policy by facilitating the access request and approval processes. This Policy assigns an Azure Policy definition that helps  monitor virtual machines that can support just-in-time access but haven't yet been configured. Just-In-Time network access control is applied on virtual machines.
