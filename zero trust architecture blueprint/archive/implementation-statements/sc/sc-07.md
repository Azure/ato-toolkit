## Control Description

The information system:

a. Monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the system and at key internal boundaries within the system;

b. Implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are [Selection: physically; logically] separated from internal organizational networks; and

c. Connects to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security architecture.

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities:

1. Monitoring and controlling communications at and within the boundaries of the Org.-deployed system. (SC-07.a)
2. Implementing subnetworks for Org. deployed resources to logically separate publicly accessible resources from internal resources. (SC-07.b)
3. Managing connections to external networks or systems using  boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with Org. security architecture, to which connections to external networks or systems will be restricted. (SC-07.c)

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

## Part a

### Implementation Statement

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to manage and control the system boundary by assigning an Azure Policy definition that monitors for network security group hardening recommendations in Azure Security Center. Azure Security Center analyzes traffic patterns of Internet facing virtual machines and provides network security group rule recommendations to reduce the potential attack surface. Additionally, this Policy also assigns policy definitions that monitor unprotected endpoints, applications, and storage accounts. Endpoints and applications that aren't protected by a firewall, and storage accounts with unrestricted access can allow unintended access to information contained within the information system.  Network security group event and diagnostic logs are collected by OMS Log Analytics to allow monitoring.
