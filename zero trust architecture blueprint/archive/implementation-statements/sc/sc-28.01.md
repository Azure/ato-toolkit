## Control Description

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of [Assignment: organization-defined information] on [Assignment: organization-defined information system components].

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities:

1. Implement cryptographic measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification on, at a minimum, PII and classified information on any information system components storing data.

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

### Implementation Statement

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to enforce the use of cryptographic controls to protect information at rest by enforcing specific cryptograph controls and auditing the use of weak cryptographic settings. This allows Org. to take corrective actions to ensure resources are configured in accordance with their information security policy. Specifically, the policy definitions assigned require encryption for data lake storage accounts, require transparent data encryption on SQL databases, and audit missing encryption on SQL databases, virtual machine disks, and automation account variables.
