## Control Description

The organization:

a. Establishes an alternate processing site including necessary agreements to permit the transfer and resumption of [Assignment: organization-defined information system operations] for essential missions/business functions within [Assignment: organization-defined time period consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives] when the primary processing capabilities are unavailable;

b. Ensures that equipment and supplies required to transfer and resume operations are available at the alternate processing site or contracts are in place to support delivery to the site within the organization-defined time period for transfer/resumption; and

c. Ensures that the alternate processing site provides information security safeguards equivalent to those of the primary site.

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities:

1. Establishing an alternate processing site that permits the transfer and resumption of Org. -defined system operations.  This should be consistent with Org. -defined recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) of 1 hour (availability High) or 12 hours (availability Moderate)) when the primary processing site is unavailable.
2. Ensure that resources are available at the alternate processing site and their ability to transfer and resume operations within the time period defined in CP-07.a.
3. Ensure the security safeguards of the alternate processing site are equivalent to that of the primary site.

Note: If the customer configures Microsoft Azure appropriately for reserving processing capacity in an alternate region, Azure can support the continuation of secure system operation.

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

## Part a

### Implementation Statement

Org. has defined additional availability zones which use a separate Azure secondary datacenter as its alternate processing site for application. The contract with Azure has the necessary agreements that permits the transfer and resumption of normal production operations for essential missions/business functions within the recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) when the primary processing capabilities are unavailable.

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Site Recovery, which replicates workloads running on virtual machines from a primary location to a secondary location. If an outage occurs at the primary site, the workload fails over the secondary location. This Policy assigns an Azure Policy definition that audits virtual machines without disaster recovery configured. Monitoring this indicator helps ensure necessary contingency controls are in place.

## Part b

### Implementation Statement

Org. has defined additional availability zones which use a separate Azure secondary datacenter as its alternate processing site for application. The contract with Azure has the necessary agreements in place as Org. inherits implementation of this control to make sure that equipment and supplies required to transfer, and resume operations are available at the alternate processing site.

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

## Part c

### Implementation Statement

Org. has defined additional availability zones which use a separate Azure secondary datacenter as its alternate processing site for application. The contract with Azure has the necessary agreements in place as Org. inherits implementation of this control to make sure security controls are equivalent in the Azure alternative site as the primary processing site.
