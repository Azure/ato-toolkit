### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities:

1. Identification and selection of all Org. controlled accounts within the system;(AC-2.a)
2. Identification and assignment of Org. account managers;(AC-2.b)
3. Establishing role and group membership criteria for Org.-controlled account types; (AC-2.c)
4. Process to define how Authorized users are specified and privilege levels are determined; (AC-2.d)
5. Process to require ISSM or ISSO to approve the creation of new accounts for the system; (AC-2.e)
6. Definition of account management process lifecycle from creation to disablement/removal; (AC-2.f)
7. Monitoring the use of all customer-controlled accounts;(AC-2.g)
8. Notification process to Org. account managers for all controlled account changes;(AC-2.h)
9. Process to grant Org. controlled accounts with valid authorizations;(AC-2.i)
10. Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements on a monthly basis for privileged access and every six months for non-privileged access;(AC-2.j)
11. Process to manage Org.-controlled shared/group account credentials;;(AC-2.k)

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

## Part a

### Implementation Statement

Org.  is responsible for identifying all customer-controlled accounts within the system.

Access control for Hosted Services and Storage accounts is governed by the subscription. The ability to authenticate with the Org.  Federated Identities associated with the subscription grants full control to all of the Hosted Services and Storage accounts within that subscription. Org. has defined various account types, roles and organized them.  Org. also manages resources that are configured and operating independent of the underlying Azure services. These privileged functions are fully defined and documented.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as Azure Active Directory (AAD).  Org. uses AAD to manage access to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

## Part c

### Implementation Statement

Org. is responsible for establishing role and group membership criteria for Org.-controlled account types.

Org. Administrators can create users accounts into roles or classes of account types. As needs arise, and under appropriate change management mechanisms, actions to modify and disable and remove accounts can take enforced to ensure account management requirements are met.

The conditions for group and role membership are dictated by the functions of the account holderâ€™s role and managed by the data or system owner to ensure privileges and functions are commensurate with business needs. Org. deployed and controlled user accounts, Org.  implements ____________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

## Part d

### Implementation Statement

Org. is responsible for the process to define how Authorized users are specified and how privilege levels are determined across all Org. managed accounts.

Org. deploys user accounts on Org.-managed user accounts and implements ____________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. uses pre-determined users and privilege information and leverage underlying Azure services to implement role and group memberships for users. Org. leverages Azure AD (AAD) to perform user Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to identify and control the access privileges of each service team personnel. Access privileges vary depending on the role.

## Part e

### Implementation Statement

Org. is responsible for the process to require the ISSM or ISSO to approve the creation of new accounts for the system.

All Org. admins are responsible for requiring appropriate approvals for requests to establish organizational accounts in compliance with Org. policy.  If service team personnel need additional access to the production environment, they request that access and provide business justifications. Service team personnel with the access approver role then review and approve/deny the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, service team personnel are assigned with the minimum permissions required to perform the work and automatically revokes permissions at the end of the specified time period.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure AD (AAD) Privileged Identity Management (PIM). With Azure AD (AAD)  Org.  can configure roles to require approval for activation and choose one or multiple users or groups as delegated approvers (ISSM or ISSO).

The processes should be automatically audited and notifications should be sent to appropriate individuals as required for all Org. managed accounts.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy. Azure Policy assigns Azure Policy definitions that audit external accounts with read, write, and owner permissions on a subscription and to deprecated accounts. By reviewing the accounts audited by these policies, Org. Administrators can create users accounts into roles or classes of account types. As needs arise, and under appropriate change management mechanisms, actions to modify and disable and remove accounts can take enforced to ensure account management requirements are met.
