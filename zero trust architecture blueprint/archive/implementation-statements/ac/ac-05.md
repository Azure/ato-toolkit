## Control Description

The organization:

a. Separates [Assignment: organization-defined duties of individuals];

b. Documents separation of duties of individuals; and

c. Defines information system access authorizations to support separation of duties.

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities:

1. Separation of duties across Org.-controlled accounts. (AC-05.a)
2. Developing and defining separation of duties of individuals using a Separation of Duties Matrix. (AC-05.b)
3. Defining information system access authorizations to support separation of duties. (AC-05.c)

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

## Part a

### Implementation Statement

Org. is responsible for enforcing separation of duties across Org.-controlled accounts in the environment.

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy definitions to maintain an appropriate number of Azure subscriptions.  Enforcement of roles and responsibilities utilizing AD security groups and Azure AD further provides segregation of duties between individuals.  Org. establishes separation of duties on critical functions within the environment, to minimize the risk of unauthorized changes to information systems. This is accomplished by separating the responsibilities for requesting, approving and deploying changes to authorized Org. personnel.

By using Azure services, Org. administrators are assigned to security roles, which have a defined list of available permissions. If an administrator needs access to the environment to perform a specific action, they request temporary Just In Time (JIT) access through the JIT portal. A different Org. administrator with the access approver role is then responsible to review and approve or deny the type of access requested. Access is only provided for a finite period of time based on the expected duration of the work to be performed. If access is approved, the administrator is assigned the minimum permissions required to perform the work, and permission is automatically revoked at the end of the specified time period. Reviews of accounts and all approved access occur monthly (See AC-2 (7)).

Implementing access control using JIT access via the JIT portal effectively prevents malevolent activity without collusion, as an individual has to review and approve the requestor's access request and would deny requests that would violate separation of duties requirements.

## Part c

### Implementation Statement

Org. is responsible for defining system access authorizations to support separation of duties across Org.-controlled accounts.

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure services to enforce separation of duties within the environment through role based security groups defined in AD. Each user is assigned to AD Security groups or a set of security groups that enforces access to the system based on the appropriate roles associated with that security group. Elevated access requests require peer approval.  Leveraging the Azure Policy allows Org. to control membership of administrators on the Azure subscriptions as well as Windows Virtual Machines.
