## Control Description

The information system:

a. Provides audit record generation capability for the auditable events defined in AU-2 a. at [Assignment: organization-defined information system components];

b. Allows [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to select which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the information system; and

c. Generates audit records for the events defined in AU-2 d. with the content defined in AU-3.

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities:

1. Ensuring all Org.-deployed resources (to include applications, operating systems, databases and software) have the ability to generate audit records for the auditable events defined in AU-2.a (AU-12.a)
2. Assigning personnel to select audit events for Org.-deployed resources.
3. Generating audit records for the subset of auditable events identified in AU-2.d and content defined in AU-3 for Org.-deployed resources

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

## Part a

### Implementation Statement

Org. validates that all application and database components are configured to generate the required audit records for auditable events (as defined in AU-2) and that these audit records will contain the necessary content (as defined in AU-3).

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to audit and enforce deployment of the Log Analytics agents on Azure virtual machines and the configuration of audit settings for other Azure resource types. These policy definitions also audit configuration of diagnostic logs to provide insight into operations that are performed within Azure resources. Additionally, auditing and Advanced Data Security are configured on SQL servers. Events audited by this Policy include those audited by Azure activity logs for deployed resources, Azure Active Directory logs, SQL Server logs, and SQL Database logs.

The Azure policy audits and deploys Log Analytics Agents on VM Image (OS) and Windows and Linuz VM Scale Sets (VMSS).  In addition, Org. uses the Azure Policy to deploy advanced data security and auditing on SQL servers and deploy diagnostic settings for Network Security Group.

## Part b

### Implementation Statement

Org. assigns security personnel to select the list of auditable events to be audited based on the assessment of risk, system/component criticality, data sensitivity, and in accordance with security standards used across the organization.

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Events audited by the Azure Policy include Azure activity logs for Azure deployed resources, Azure Active Directory logs, SQL Server logs, and SQL Database logs.

### Org.'s Customer Responsibility

TODO: Fill this out as needed or remove the section

## Part c

### Implementation Statement

Org. ensures that Org.-controlled information system components generate audit records for the subset of auditable events identified in AU-2.d with the content defined in AU-3.

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. is able to ensure system events are logged by assigning Azure Policy definitions that audit log settings on Azure resources. After defining resource types, the built-in policy checks whether diagnostic settings are enabled.
