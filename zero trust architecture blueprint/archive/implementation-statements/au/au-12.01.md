## Control Description

The information system compiles audit records from [Assignment: organization-defined information system components] into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to within [Assignment: organization-defined level of tolerance for the relationship between time stamps of individual records in the audit trail].

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities:

1. Compiling audit records into a system-wide audit trail for Org.-deployed resources (to include applications, operating systems, databases and software)
2. Addressing the level of tolerance allowed between time stamps of individual records in the audit trail.

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

### Implementation Statement

Org. is responsible for compiling audit records into a system-wide audit trail for Org.-deployed resources (to include applications, operating systems, databases and software).

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to ensure system events are logged by assigning Azure Policy definitions that audit log settings on Azure resources. After defining resource types, the built-in policy checks whether diagnostic settings are enabled.
