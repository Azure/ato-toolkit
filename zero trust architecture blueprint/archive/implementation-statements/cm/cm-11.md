## Control Description

The organization:

a. Establishes [Assignment: organization-defined policies] governing the installation of software by users;

b. Enforces software installation policies through [Assignment: organization-defined methods]; and

c. Monitors policy compliance at [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities:

1. Establishing policy governing user-installed software on  Org. deployed resources. (CM-11.a)
2. Enforcing the policy governing user-installed software on  Org. deployed resources by users. (CM-11.b)
3. Monitor the compliance of the policy governing user-installed software on  Org. deployed resources by users. (CM-11.c)
4. Define a frequency at which policy compliance is monitored. (CM-11.c)

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.
