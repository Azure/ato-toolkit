## Control Description

The organization:
(a) Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined software programs authorized to execute on the information system];

(b) Employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs on the information system; and

(c) Reviews and updates the list of authorized software programs [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities:

1. Org. is responsible for employing a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs on customer-deployed resources. The customer control implementation statement should address the employed policy.
2. Org. is responsible for reviewing and updating the list of authorized software programs at least monthly.
3. Org. is responsible for establishing a policy governing the installation of software on customer-deployed resources by users.

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.
