## Control Description

The organization:

a. Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications [Assignment: organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported;

b. Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:

1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;

2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and

3. Measuring vulnerability impact;

c. Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;

d. Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and

e. Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities:

1. Perform authenticated vulnerability scans on all Org. deployed resources (monthly) (i.e.: scanning for patch levels, for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices, for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms, or any other potential vulnerabilities). (RA-5.a)
2. Perform web applications scans on all Org. deployed web resources (monthly). (RA-5.a)
3. Perform database scans (monthly, when possible). (RA-5.a)
4. Perform authenticated vulnerability scans on all Org. deployed resources when additional software is installed, software is reconfigured, a service is added, or patches are applied. (RA-5.a)
5. Perform authenticated vulnerability scans on all Org. deployed resources when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported. (RA-5.a)
6. Analyze and triage scan reports and results from security control assessments to identify vulnerabilities to remediate, confirm false positives, make risk adjustments, and create prioritized actions to undertake. (RA-5.c)
7. Remediating vulnerabilities identified as a result of vulnerability scanning activities in a timely manner, as defined by IAW an authoritative source (e.g. IAVM, CTOs, DTMs); FedRAMP Parameters: High Risk: within 30 days, Moderate Risk: within 90 days, Low Risk: within 180 days. (RA-5.d)
8. Reporting the results and/or resulting information of vulnerability scanning activities to, at a minimum, the ISSM and ISSO. (RA-5.e)

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

## Part a

### Implementation Statement

Org. utilizes vulnerability scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities on Org. deployed resources and to perform quarterly compliance scans using the appropriate security benchmarks.  In addition, Org. performs additional scans based on an alternate as-needed frequency, such as when additional software is installed, software is reconfigured, a service is added, or patches are applied.

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to manage information system vulnerabilities by assigning Policy definitions that monitor operating system vulnerabilities, SQL vulnerabilities, and virtual machine vulnerabilities in Azure Security Center. Org. leverages Azure Security Center to provide reporting capabilities to have real-time insight into the security state of deployed Azure resources; ASC provides dashboards that show vulnerabilities that need to be remediated. This Policy also assigns policy definitions that audit and enforce Advanced Data Security on SQL servers; this helps captures security weaknesses in databases.

## Part b

### Implementation Statement

The tools and techniques are performed, as described in RA-5 part a, to promote interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process in order to:

* Enumerate platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations where possible;
* Format and make transparent, checklists and test procedures; and
* Measure vulnerability impact.
