description: Rules for generic YAML file
type: YAML
files:
  - "*.config"
#  See: https://github.com/stelligent/config-lint/blob/master/example-files/rules/generic-yaml.yml
# For generic YAML linting, we need a list of resources 
# Each entry in the list describes the resource type, how to discover it in the file, and how to get its ID
# The key attribute is a JMESPath expression that should return an array

resources:
  - type: widget
    key: widgets[]
    id: id
  - type: gadget
    key: gadgets[]
    id: name
  - type: contraption
    key: other_stuff.contraptions[]
    id: ids.serial_number
  # include the root document in a single element array with a literal id
  - type: document
    key: '[@]'
    id: '`"Document"`'
