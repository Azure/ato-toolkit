## Control Description

The information system prevents program execution in accordance with [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined policies regarding software program usage and restrictions]; rules authorizing the terms and conditions of software program usage].

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities:

1. Preventing program execution in accordance with Org.-defined software program usage policies.

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

### Implementation Statement

Org. implements ______________________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to enable Adaptive application control in Azure Security Center.  This provides end-to-end application whitelisting solution that can block or prevent specific software from running on Org.  virtual machines. Org. can also enable enforcement mode that prohibits non-approved applications from running. Additionally, Org. can monitor virtual machines where an application whitelist is recommended but has not yet been configured.
