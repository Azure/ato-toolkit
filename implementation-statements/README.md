> Customers should use these 'implementation-statements' as a starting point to populate their System Security Plans (SSP) and other relevant compliance documentation. However, Customer responsibility statements are guiding principles for customers and their 3PAOs (compliance assessors) and should be used as reference points for implementations statements and overall responsibilities. Microsoft provides general guidance on responsibilities and pre-populates, to the extent feasible, implementation statements based on Azure services in scope. Customer configurations can vary due to the scope of their implementation. Please evaluate all statements before final SSP incorporation.
