## Control Description

The organization:

a. Monitors the information system to detect:

1. Attacks and indicators of potential attacks in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined monitoring objectives]; and
2. Unauthorized local, network, and remote connections;

b. Identifies unauthorized use of the information system through [Assignment: organization-defined techniques and methods];

c. Deploys monitoring devices:

1. Strategically within the information system to collect organization-determined essential information; and
2. At ad hoc locations within the system to track specific types of transactions of interest to the organization;

d. Protects information obtained from intrusion-monitoring tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion;

e. Heightens the level of information system monitoring activity whenever there is an indication of increased risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources of information;

f. Obtains legal opinion with regard to information system monitoring activities in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, or regulations; and

g. Provides [Assignment: organization-defined information system monitoring information] to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] [Selection (one or more): as needed; [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]].

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following:

1. Monitoring Org. deployed resources (to include applications, operating systems, databases, and software) for attacks and indicators of potential attacks; through the use of various tools and techniques. (SI-4.a)
2. Monitoring Org. deployed resources (to include applications, operating systems, databases, and software) for unauthorized local, network, and remote connections; through the use of various tools and techniques. (SI-4.a)
    Monitoring activities can include:
    - observation of events occurring at the information system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection)
    - observing audit activities in real time
    - observing system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions
    - leveraging Tools/techniques: intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software, audit log correlation/review
3. Identify unauthorized use of the information system through the use of security/network monitoring tools and correlations/review of audit logs. (SI-4.b)
4. Deploying monitoring tools and devices at Org. defined and ad hoc locations to collect essential information and track specific types of transactions; in order to provide thorough picture of activities occurring inside the information system, in order to meet monitoring objectives. (SI-4.c)
5. Limit access (through the use of Role Based Access Control) to intrusion-monitoring tools in order to protect information from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion. (SI-4.d)
6. Defines a process/strategy to heighten the level of information system wide monitoring activity due to an indication of increased risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources of information. This process should include enhanced metrics for scanning activities, audit log reviews, and real-time dashboard reviews. (SI-4.e)
7. Obtaining legal opinion with regard to information system monitoring activities in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, or regulations; in order to confirm activities are not over intrusive. (SI-4.f)
8. Reporting the results and/or resulting information of monitoring activities and information related to a change in security posture and vulnerabilities that affects the DoD Mission Owner’s system/application/information to the AOs who issued the PA and the customer’s ATO, and the DoD Mission Owner’s MCD as needed. (SI-4.g)

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

## Part a

### Implementation Statement

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to monitor the system by auditing and enforcing logging and data security across Azure resources. Specifically, the policies assigned audit and enforce deployment of the Log Analytics agent and enhanced security settings for SQL databases, storage accounts and network resources. This policy also deploys the Log Analytics and the OMS Security and Audit solution in order to provide a comprehensive view of security posture, attacks, and indicators of potential attacks. The Security and Audit dashboard provides high-level insight into the security state of deployed resources using data available across deployed OMS solutions. This allows Org. to detect anomalous behavior and indicators of attacks so appropriate action can be taken.

## Part b

### Implementation Statement

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to deploy the OMS Security and Audit solution for Azure resources. The Identify and Access domain provides a dashboard with an overview of the information system identity state, including number of failed attempts to log on and current number of accounts that are logged in. The information available in this dashboard assists in identification of potential suspicious activity.

## Part d

### Implementation Statement

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to enable logical access controls to protect monitoring information from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion. Azure Active Directory enforces approved logical access using role-based group memberships. The ability to view monitoring information and use monitoring tools is limited to users that require those permissions.
