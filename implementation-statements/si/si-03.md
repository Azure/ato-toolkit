## Control Description

The organization:

a. Employs malicious code protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points to detect and eradicate malicious code;

b. Updates malicious code protection mechanisms whenever new releases are available in accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures;

c. Configures malicious code protection mechanisms to:

1. Perform periodic scans of the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and real-time scans of files from external sources at [Selection (one or more); endpoint; network entry/exit points] as the files are downloaded, opened, or executed in accordance with organizational security policy; and
2. [Selection (one or more): block malicious code; quarantine malicious code; send alert to administrator; [Assignment: organization-defined action]] in response to malicious code detection; and

d. Addresses the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and the resulting potential impact on the availability of the information system.  

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following:

1. Employ malicious code protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points (i.e.: firewalls, mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers, workstations/computers) to detect and eradicate malicious code; this may include the use of anti-virus and anti-malware software with properly enforced and updated signatures. (SI-3.a)
2. Updates malicious code protection mechanisms (anti-virus and anti-malware software and signatures) whenever new releases are available. (SI-3.b)
3. Define, configure, and implement malicious code protection mechanisms to perform periodic scans of the information system every 7 days. (SI-3.c)
4. Define, configure, and implement malicious code protection mechanisms to perform real-time scans of files from external sources at endpoints and network entry/exit points; in order to scans files as they are downloaded, opened, or executed. (SI-3.c)
5. Once malicious code has been detected, block and quarantine malicious code and then send an alert to the administrator immediately in near real-time. (SI-3.c)
6. Define actions to take to review and confirm the potential impact or validity of false positives discovered during malicious code detection. (SI-3.d)

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

## Part a

### Implementation Statement

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to manage endpoint protection, including malicious code protection, by assigning Azure Policy definitions that monitor for missing endpoint protection on virtual machines in Azure Security Center and enforce the Microsoft antimalware solution on Windows virtual machines.
