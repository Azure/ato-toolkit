## Control Description

The organization:

a. Identifies, reports, and corrects information system flaws;

b. Tests software and firmware updates related to flaw remediation for effectiveness and potential side effects before installation;

c. Installs security-relevant software and firmware updates within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of the release of the updates; and

d. Incorporates flaw remediation into the organizational configuration management process.

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities:

1. Identify system flaws and security-relevant updates (i.e.: patches, service packs, hot fixes, signatures) on Org. deployed resources (which may include applications, operating systems, databases, and software) through the use of security tooling and processes.  These can also be identified during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. (SI-2.a)
2. Report the identified information on system flaws to designated organizational personnel with information security responsibilities. (SI-2.a)
3. Correct or implement identified system flaws and security-relevant updates on Org. deployed resources following the Change Management Process. (SI-2.a)
4. Defining and implementing how Org. test updates for software and firmware for effectiveness or potential side effects, before installation in or pushing to the production environment; Org. should determine the degree and type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration. (SI-2.b)
5. Installing updates released for software and firmware on Org. resources within a Org. defined time period; based on the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update. (SI-2.c)
6. Defining how Org. incorporates the process for flaw remediation (outlined in SI-2) into their configuration management process (CM family); to assist in tracking and verifying remediation actions. (SI-2.d)

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

## Part a

### Implementation Statement

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to manage information system flaws by assigning Azure Policy definitions that monitor missing system updates, operating system vulnerabilities, SQL vulnerabilities, and virtual machine vulnerabilities in Azure Security Center. Azure Security Center provides reporting capabilities that enable real-time insight into the security state of deployed Azure resources. This Policy also assigns a policy definition that ensures patching of the operating system for virtual machine scale sets.
