## Control Description

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to [Selection (one or more): prevent unauthorized disclosure of information; detect changes to information] during transmission unless otherwise protected by [Assignment: organization-defined alternative physical safeguards].

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities:

1. Implement cryptographic measures for all data in transit (transmission) using SSL certificates, at all Org. deployed locations; unless a Protected Distribution System (PDS) is implemented.

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

### Implementation Statement

Org. implements ______________________________________________________.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to protect the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information by assigning Azure Policy definitions that help monitor cryptographic mechanisms implemented for communications protocols.  This ensures communications are properly encrypted protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
