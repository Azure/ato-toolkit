## Control Description

The organization manages information system authenticators by:

a. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, role, or device receiving the authenticator;

b. Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by the organization;

c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;

d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;

e. Changing default content of authenticators prior to information system installation;

f. Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for authenticators;

g. Changing/refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined time period by authenticator type];

h. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;

i. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security safeguards to protect authenticators; and

j. Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities across the entire Org. environment (including the application layer:

1. Managing authenticators including verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, role, or device receiving the authenticator (e.g., verifying an individualâ€™s identity with a government-issued identification card). (IA-5.a)
2. Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators (IA-5.b)
3. Ensuring authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism (IA-5.c)
4. Establishing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised authenticators, and for revoking authenticators (IA-5.d)
5. Changing default content of authenticators prior to deployment (IA-5.e)
6. Establishment of minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for authenticators (IA-5.f)
7. Changing/refreshing authenticators and establishing the corresponding time period for each authenticator type after which an update is required (IA-5.g)
8. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclose or modification (IA-5.h)
9. Choosing protection measures and devices to provide security safeguards to protect authenticators (IA-5.i)
10. Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership changes occur (IA-5.j)

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

## Part a

### Implementation Statement

Org. manages privileged user authenticators by verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, role, or device receiving the authenticator. Access to Org. resources are limited to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of authorized users, other information systems, and functions that are authorized to operate and maintain the information system.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. leverages Azure Policy to assign Policy definitions that audit Linux virtual machines that allow remote connections from accounts without passwords and/or have incorrect permissions set on the password file. This Policy also assigns policy definitions that audit the configuration of the password encryption type for Windows virtual machines. Monitoring these indicators helps Org. ensure that system authenticators comply with their organization's identification and authentication policy. All initial authenticator content for accounts created by this Policy meet the requirements stated in IA-5 (1).

## Part b

### Implementation Statement

Org. manages privileged user authenticators by establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators. Initial authenticators and default passwords are required to be removed, disabled, or changed upon installation of all information systems.

At the time of initial account creation, Active Directory assigns a unique identification and random temporary password which meets policy requirements. Active Directory maintains the unique identification associated with the account throughout the life of the account. Account identification is never repeated within Active Directory.

## Part c

### Implementation Statement

Org. manages authenticators by ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use.  Password creation follow the following standards:

* minimum of twelve characters
* case sensitive
* at least one of each of the following: upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters
* 1 character changed during password refresh
* Minimum lifetime restriction of one day
* Maximum lifetime restriction of sixty days
* Twenty-four passwords remembered

## Part e

### Implementation Statement

Whenever an initial password is created by a system or administrator, Org. requires the password to be changed at the first use, in order to prevent unauthorized users who may have determined the original password from accessing the information system. This is especially important where a standard format initial password is used for a system. Initial passwords are random and unique wherever possible.

## Part f

### Implementation Statement

Org. has established minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for authenticators.  Org. establishes the minimum lifetime of one day and a maximum lifetime of sixty (60) days for privileged user accounts. The authenticators cannot be used for a total of 24 generations.

## Part h

### Implementation Statement

Org. Administrators protect authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification by adhering to inherent cryptographic modules within Active Directory (AD).  AD has been configured so that it does not store passwords using reversible encryption. In addition, all authentication is conducted using TLS 1.1 or higher. Each individual user is responsible for safeguarding their authenticators (passwords and tokens) and ensuring that they are not shared or revealed to anyone.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

In addition, Org. leverages Azure Policy to implement Key Vault to protect authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification. The following authenticators are stored in Key Vault: Azure password for deploy account, SQL Server service account password, and SQL Database service account password. Key Vault encrypts keys and secrets (such as authentication keys, storage account keys, data encryption keys, and passwords) by using keys that are protected by hardware security modules (HSMs).

The Azure policy is able to audit Windows VMs that do not store passwords using reversible encryption and deploy requirements to audit Windows VMs that do not store passwords using reversible encryption.

All Org. personnel and contractors are required to maintain personal accountability for practicing ethical security practices.  Personnel and contractors are required to adhere to published policies, practices, and guidelines that identify the proper administration and use of security authentication codes and devices assigned to them.

## Part j

### Implementation Statement

In order to get access to shared/group accounts, there are multiple layers of authentication required, including multifactor authentication. When a user leaves the group, their credentials are terminated and thus access to the system is terminated. Therefore, those accounts cannot be accessed by the termianted user.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. leverages underlying Azure services to re-issue credentials for shared/group accounts when an individual leaves the group, using Azure AD (AAD) and Privileged Identity Management (PIM). Org. manages credentials for all user accounts including shared/group accounts using AAD.
