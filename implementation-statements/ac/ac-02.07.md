## Control Description

The organization:

(a) Establishes and administers privileged user accounts in accordance with a role-based access scheme that organizes allowed information system access and privileges into roles;

(b) Monitors privileged role assignments; and

(c) Takes [Assignment: organization-defined actions] when privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate.

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

If Org. enables relevant Azure policies to implement this control, Org. is still responsible for providing the following capabilities:

1. Establishing and administering privileged Org. user accounts in accordance with Role-based access schemes that organizes allowed information system access and privileges into roles (AC-02(07).a)
2. Monitoring of privileged role assignments for Org.-controlled accounts (AC-02(07).b)
3. Taking organization-defined actions when privileged role assignments are no longer required. (AC-02(07).c)

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

## Part a

### Implementation Statement

Org.  is responsible for establishing and administering privileged user accounts in accordance with Role-based access schemes that organizes allowed information system access and privileges into roles. Access is granted only to users with legitimate business need to access resources within the environment.  

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as _________________.

Org. leverages Azure Policy to implements the following system account types: Azure Active Directory users, SQL Server service account, and SQL Database service account. Azure Active Directory account privileges are implemented using role-based access control by assigning users to roles. These role-based schemes are extended by the customer to meet mission needs. Additionally, using the Azure portal, Org. Corp Administrators review access to Azure resources and assigns an Azure Policy definition to audit the use of custom RBAC rules.

## Part b

### Implementation Statement

Org.  is responsible for monitoring privileged roles of customer-controlled accounts.

Org. monitors privileged role assignments through account reviews.  If an individual is identified as having access to a higher privileged role, the reviewing team is responsible to identify the role the User needs to be transitioned to and communicate (via the ticketing system/email) to appropriate account managers the change that needs to be executed.

TODO: Optional placeholder for non Azure, OSS or custom implementations

Org. implements various Azure services to meet this control requirement such as Azure Active Directory (AAD), Privileged Identity Management (PIM), and Azure AD Portal.  Privileged access to resources is time-limited, controlled and monitored through PIM. PIM protects administrator access by limiting permanent membership in privileged roles such as Global Administrators and by monitoring their activation and expiration.  In addition, Org. leverages the Azure Policy to implement the OMS Security and Audit Solutions Identity and Access Dashboard to enable account managers to monitor the use of information system accounts.  This solution is queried to report privileged role assignments to review role assignments.  Additionally, Org. Administrators review access to Azure resources and assign Azure Policy definitions to audit the use of custom RBAC roles (see AC-2 part j).
