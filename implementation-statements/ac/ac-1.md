## Control Description

The organization:

a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:

1. An access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and

2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated access controls; and

b. Reviews and updates the current:

1. Access control policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and

2. Access control procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

### Org. Shared Responsibilities Guidance

All customers should review their Customer Responsibilities requirements as documented in Microsoft Azure SSPs. Customers are responsible for implementation and documentation of controls not inherited directly from Microsoft. This includes all controls where a Shared or Customer provided responsibility is defined by Microsoft Azure.

Org. should clearly document in the section below how it implements controls requirements.

## Part a

### Implementation Statement

Org. has formal Access Control policies for the information system as documented in the Org. Policies and Procedures – Access Control document.

Org. has developed procedures to facilitate the implementation of the Access Control policy and associated controls as documented in the Org. Policies and Procedures – Access Control document.

The policies and procedures are stored on [storage location](TODO: Place the url) and made available to all personnel who require access to the documents.

## Part b

### Implementation Statement

Org. reviews and updates the Org. Access Control policy at least annually or when a significant change occurs.  Org. also reviews and updates the Org. Access Control procedures on at least an annual basis or whenever there is a significant change.
